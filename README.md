# stop-divi-flash
This JS snippet stops the Divi WordPress theme from flashing unstyled content before loading the stylesheet.

Note: in order to use this code, you need to paste it into the box in Divi -> Theme Options -> Integration -> "Add code to the < head > of your blog". It will not work if you try to enqueue it as you normally do in WordPress.
